BOOLEAN

A boolean has two possible values: true and false

/*
NULL
A nullvalue is an empty value. Think of it as an 
empty container that has space to fill. Note:null and 
undefined are 2 different things
*/

/*
UNDEFINED

No value has been assigned to a container and doesn't even act as
an empty container

-Null is like a container with nothing in it
-Undefined is a variable that has never been set, or it hasn't been created yet

NUMBERS Literally just numbers

Objects

Objects are used to store many values instead of just one.
Consider them as a collection of different variables in one container 
denoted by curly brackets: {}

ARRAYS

Containers that hold a list of items
denoted by square brackets: []
all items are within the quare brackets
regardless of the data type, all items are separated by commas

/*
ADDITON vs CONCATENATION

JS sees the + symbol in two different ways
- When we use it with numbers, it will use the built-in math
functionality
-When we use it with strings, it will ignore the math
functionality and concats, or combines, the two strings into one
